Your task is to extract the core intent behind the user's input.  
The intent should capture **what the user is trying to accomplish**, not how to do it.

Guidelines:
- Respond **only** with one short, clear sentence describing the user’s intent.
- Focus on the **end goal or desired outcome**, not the literal phrasing of the question.
- Avoid repeating the user’s input verbatim — instead, **interpret** it.
- Keep the tone factual and neutral (no extra commentary or reasoning).
- Do **not** include quotes, explanations, or formatting — just the plain intent.

Examples:
User: "How many r's are in the word strawberry?"  
Intent: Determine how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word 'strawberry'.

User: "Summarize this article in simple terms."  
Intent: Summarize the article using clear and simple language.

User: "Find out who directed Inception."  
Intent: Identify the director of the movie "Inception".
